## Sprig UI

#### About

**CLIENT-SIDE MENTALITY**
Sprig is a bit of an experiment to design from the client-side down instead of the server-side up. To consider how a person would actually use a tool like this, and build out the functionality based on that. Though the project is still very young, it's designed to be fast, simple, and intuitive.

**MOVEMENT**
Scheduling is all about getting something on the books. Introducing too many variables often slows and prevents this from happening. Sprig removes a lot of extraneous information that clutters the page, and the decision-making process. By limiting options with a minimalistic interface, choices can happen faster. It employs a lot of JavaScript and JQuery to keep the application flow moving. This is not a lake where people want to lounge and hang out. It's a river, and you've got somewhere to be.

**BEAUTY**
Spring has an affinity for visually pleasing design. You've got somewhere to be, but you can enjoy the ride. Color, font weight, kerning, edges, and transitions are all essential to Sprig.

#### Where It's At

**0.0.1**
It's a mess. It's all in one file. It's mixing JQuery and Javascript with the HTML, and while it packs the data into an object, it isn't actually doing anything with it. It's a pure UI, all interface and no brains. But that's what's next. Give it some intelligence so it can interact with the world.
